# according to page XVI, the source code under the GPL 3 license.
# The library has been modified a little bit to fit the need of the project and some classes like
# Actor and Rectangle have been inspired by libgdx a library written by Mario Zechner and Nathan
# Sweet here mention as co author of the code.
